    <ul>
        <li>  Blood Pressure Monitor (Sphygmomanometer):

Used to measure blood pressure.
Wrap the cuff around the upper arm, aligning it with the heart.
Inflate the cuff to a pressure higher than the expected systolic pressure.
Gradually release the pressure while listening for the sounds of blood flow with a stethoscope (for manual monitors) or observing the digital display (for automatic monitors).
Record the systolic and diastolic pressure readings.</li>
        <li>  Stethoscope:

Used to listen to heart sounds, lung sounds, and blood flow sounds.
Place the earpieces in your ears and position the chestpiece (diaphragm or bell) over the area of interest.
Listen carefully to identify any abnormalities in heart or lung sounds.</li>
     
        <li>Pulse Oximeter:

Measures oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate.
Attach the sensor to a fingertip, toe, or earlobe.
Wait for the device to display the oxygen saturation and pulse rate readings.</li>
      <li>Thermometer:

Measures body temperature.
Depending on the type of thermometer (oral, rectal, tympanic, or temporal artery), follow the manufacturer's instructions for use.
Place the thermometer in the appropriate location and wait for the reading to stabilize. </li>
      <li>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) Machine:

Measures the electrical activity of the heart.
Attach electrodes to specific locations on the patient's chest, arms, and legs.
Start the machine to record the heart's electrical signals.
Analyze the ECG waveform for abnormalities. </li>
